    <p>The idea behind the first BMW M3 was to make a racing sedan available as a street
         version. Nobody foresaw just what a roaring success the M3 would become – on everyday
          roads as well as the world’s greatest race tracks. As a touring car racing 
          homologation model, the BMW M3 finally rolled to the starting line in 1986.
           The Group A regulations required that at least 5,000 road-legal copies of a racing
            car had to be sold within twelve months in order for a vehicle to be homologated
             for racing.
        Before that, the technicians at BMW Motorsport GmbH 
        (the company name of BMW M until 1993) had done a great job.
         The developers supplied the future M3 with the best components from the BMW Racing 
         Parts shelf. The brake system with ABS and ventilated discs ensured it was steadfast,
          while the suspension and damping were designed with racing in mind – without 
          sacrificing suitability for everyday use.
           The manual transmission also radiated classic racing flair,
            so drivers found the first gear on the bottom left, as is typical in racing.
             Meanwhile, BMW Motorsport GmbH took over little more than the doors and the roof
              from the BMW 3 Series production car.</p>
