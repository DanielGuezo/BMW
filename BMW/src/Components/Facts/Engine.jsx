    <p>200 hp. The power output of the first BMW M3 engine - no need for six cylinders or a turbocharger

The heart of the BMW M3 was undoubtedly its sophisticated four-cylinder engine. The basis for this was the two-litre four-cylinder from the then 3 Series, which was completely revised. Among the best features of the original engine were its low weight, high torque and durability. The typical M power treatment included increasing the displacement to 2.3 litres and integrating a four-valve head. This technology was already known in a modified form from the BMW M1 super sports car.

6,15 Kg/hp
The power-to-weight ratio of the first BMW M3, impressive at the time, still ensures a lot of driving fun today.
LIGHT AND FAST.
The first BMW M3’s performance data was a benchmark at the time and this remains the case, even today. Thanks to racing technology, the engine climbs exactly to the 200 hp mark – and achieves this without a turbocharger or compressor. Its maximum speed is 6,750 rpm. Thanks to the vehicle's slim weight of around 1,200 kilograms, the M3 reaches 100 km/h after just 6.7 seconds and boasts a top speed of 235 km/h. With the regulated catalytic converter, which was very advanced for its time, the engine only lost a little power down to 195 hp – a still considerable figure.
